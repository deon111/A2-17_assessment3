<p>The current stage of our project is a clickable prototype, the purpose this artifact is to convey the layout and design of the application to the engineers, who will develop the back end of the app. When creating this prototype, we considered key design principles, the colour scheme and typeface, as well as making the app easy and simple to navigate and use.</p>

<p>We wanted the design to have a strong element of user-friendliness. To achieve this, we used large and easy to identify buttons and text, as well as keeping the pages simple. We kept a limited number of pages, to keep the navigation simple with back and home buttons, back taking the user to the previous page and home button taking them to the main page. </p>

<p>We used the Ariel font because of its easy legibility, alternating the typeface colour between grey and light blue depending on the background. The use of light blue as the main colour was a conscious choice, as mentioned in the Project Description it promotes logic and intellectual thought.</p>

<p>This artifact will be passed on to the engineering team for further development and construction of the app.</p>

        <p class="lead text-primary">Aims</p>
         <img src="adobexd.png" alt="..." class="align-right">
          <p>The aim is to construct a smartphone app prototype in Adobe XD to display our vision for Express Health and to show the codes we plan to use for creating the app. Express Health’s purpose is to help patients be more expressive with their HCPs and to reliably record medical consultations for patients. To achieve this, we have set out the following goals that the prototype should display: Being able to create personal accounts, accepting user input for basic personal information, being able to edit and use the editable QPLs which also includes the recording features, being able to edit consultation times in the calendar feature and being able to use the geolocation feature. The codes that will be used to program these features will be included in the Plans and Progresses section.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Personal Accounts</p>
          <p>Personal accounts are an important feature to have, this stores the user’s personal information, such as their current height, weight and age, as well as allowing them to input any known allergies they have, i.e. penicillin or other types of medications, and any known medical conditions they may have, i.e. Arthritis or Asthma. This will help users keep track of their own medical information. </p>
          <br>
          <p>The Question Prompt List</p>
          <p>The Question Prompt List is the main focus of Express Health. For this feature we want to have a vast number of QPL questions available for the user, covering various medical conditions and treatments. This is to help the user during a consultation by providing them with questions to ask their HCP. The user will also be able to edit, delete and add their own questions. Moreover, they will be able to add pictures and voice and video recordings.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Calendar</p>
          <p>The calendar feature will allow the user to store and edit their appointment times in a virtual calendar, this will include the time, date and which doctor the consultation is with. Another element of this feature will be the app sending push notifications to remind the user of upcoming appointments. This feature is to help the user to keep track of appointments.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Geolocation</p>
          <P>The Geolocation will use a map element. This map is for the user to easily locate and access directions to medical facilities close to the user’s current location, using the user's current IP address. The idea behind this was to allow the user to access a direct map rather than having to switch in between apps, this is for convenience to the user.</P>
          <br>
        <p class="lead text-primary">Plans and Progress</p>
         <p>This project idea began with finding a solution for a relative whom was struggling to remember most of what doctors have said about her chronic illnesses. The relative had an illness that required regular medical consultations and several treatments so keeping track and managing all this information was laborious. Using knowledge from a psychology health management class about QPLs and inspired by the trendy mHealth industry, Express Health’s initial project idea was born. The idea involved a smartphone app that had QPLs with editable questions. This was to help patients effectively communicate with HCPs and plan what questions to ask before seeing HCPs. </p>  

  

<p>After researching online about similar apps like Medcorder and Abridge, the recording features and adding pictures features were integrated into the QPLs. These were done to further assist users with efficient information management and sharing. Another intention of the recording features was to hold HCPs accountable for their advice and conduct during medical consultations. Poor communication on the part of HCPs have led to misdiagnoses, misunderstandings and either no or unnecessary medical tests (Kirby, Kirby & Sokolove 2015). This issue is the most common reason for litigations against HCPs (Kirby, Kirby & Sokolove 2015). Moreover, it will help keep patients safe from the unethical behavior of HCPs like sexual misconduct. Bismark et al. (2020) found that in Australia, sexual misconduct is rare, only 0.2% of registered health practitioners were reported from 2011-2016. However, sexual misconduct by HCPs generally have severe negative effects on patients, not just because of the nature of the misconduct, but also because patients tend to be vulnerable and trusting when interacting with HCPs (Bismark et al. 2020). Hence, the current version of the editable QPLs was created for A1. </p> 

  

<p>The target audience for the app was the general public. The reasoning for that was that most people go to medical consultations and the app could assist all those individuals. </p> 

  

<p>After receiving feedback for A1, the team researched and discussed how to improve the project idea which was too simplistic. The team decided to add an online medical consultation feature. This is a timely addition because of the Covid-19 pandemic. There is high demand for telemedicine apps as most people preferred having minimum contact with others to prevent infection (Bakhtiar, Elbuluk & Lipoff 2020). Other typical features of online consultation apps such as prescription services and sharing of medical information and recorded medical consultations through email were also added (Bakhtiar, Elbuluk & Lipoff 2020).</p>  

  

<p>As per the suggestions of the A1 feedback, the legal aspects of recording consultations were also further researched. Recording consultations was legal in all states of Australia as long as all parties involved consented to it (Prictor, Johnston & Hyatt 2020). The specifics of the laws in each state is shown in Table 1 below. </p>

<p>When we received feedback for the new project idea, A2, we realized that the added features are too complex and large to implement. Although, the technical aspects were not complicated to carry out, we lacked the expertise and personnel for detailed planning and research. There are also multiple individuals and institutions that needs to be involved in making online consultations possible such as HCPs, lawyers and medical facilities. For example, A2 features such as online web consultations with GPs will require ongoing payment and maintenance with HCPs and high-level programmers. Overall, the A2 project plan is not feasible for a startup group; however, these features may be possible post-release and if the app is successful. For practical purposes, we revised our project idea. </p> 

  

After careful consideration, the group has elected to use a revised adaptation of the original project idea, produced in A1, as the final project plan. The final project plan will reject most features of the A2 project idea and will comprise of the following features:    
<ul>
<li>A login form to permit access to saved data.</li>    

<li>Editable QPLs – adding/editing questions, inputting images, videos, or voice recordings. </li>   

<li>Recording consultations.</li>   

<li>Identify and display route to the nearest medical practitioner or hospital - through Google Maps </li>   
</ul>

<p>Launching an app is a challenging task in the modern-day online landscape as the competition is fierce, and markets are oversaturated. However, an editable QPL (a unique feature), will provide a competitive advantage over other businesses. The limited features on the final project plan has also concentrated the group’s efforts, allowing us to deliver higher quality results. It may produce a polished, optimised and user convenient app.</p>

<p>Final Project Plan</p>
<ol>Introduced changes to the project plan are:
<li>Improved business model.</li>
<li>Solution and procedure for advertisement.</li>
<li>Solution for storing user data. </li>
<li>Administrative requirements.</li>
<li>Target audience changed to patients with chronic illnesses that regularly goes to medical consultations    </li>
</ol>

<p>Business Model</p>    

<p>A business model is a series of strategies to identify and anticipate trends and challenges for the company to make a profit.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Value Proposition: What are we building and for who?    

<p>It is difficult to think when we are under pressure, we become flustered, forgetful and miss out key details and intricacies. We can experience these symptoms when we attend our medical consultations. </p>    

<p>The solution to this problem is offered in Express Health, an editable QPL which makes the patient’s life easier as well as help HCPs do their job well.</p></li>

<li> Target audience/customers: 
	<ol>
		<li>Customers with health issues that must visit the doctors often. Most research involving QPLs and recording medical consultations are based on this population so it is more likely that our features will be more useful to this group than for other types of patients (Lukasczik et al. 2020; Rieger et al. 2017). Moreover, this customer type is compatible with the business model of Express Health which is dependent on long-term interest, use and investment. The app might be considered too expensive or unnecessary for customers that do not frequently need to see HCPs.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
<li>Channels:
	<ol>
		<li>Advertise in doctor’s waiting rooms with posters and videos. The A5 presentation video can be shown in the waiting room. This is where the target audiences are located.  Client contact details for advertising, can be acquired through online research. https://healthengine.com.au/  provides contact details for Practices’, including phone numbers and websites.</li>
		<li>Online advertising: Social media and online advertisements can increase brand presence and awareness.  Furthermore, reviews on websites such as Trustpilot, have a significant influence on the outlook of this app.</li>
	</ol>
</li>

<li>Customer relationship/Marketing:
	<dl>
		<dt>How do we get them?</dt>
		<dd>Implement an effective marketing strategy.</dd>
		<dt>How do we keep them?</dt>
		<dd>Provide an outstanding service.</dd>
		<dd>Email marketing campaigns to retain customers and nature potential leads.</dd>
		<dd>Discount pricing strategies (e.g., “Subscribe within the next 2 hours to receive 30% discount).</dd>
	</dl>	
</li>

<li>Revenue Streams:
	<ol>
		<li>Subscription based - 60-day trial. Revenue stream can be optimised with user feedback, after the product has been released.</li>
	</ol>
</li>

<li>Resources: what are required to make the business model work?    
	<ol>
		<li>Loan from a bank.</li>
		<li>Programmers.</li>
		<li>Contact with HCPs for advertising purposes. </li>
		<li>Lawyers for creating advertising contracts. </li>
		<li>Lawyers for creating advertising contracts. </li>
	</ol>
</li>

<li>Activities: What are the most important things a company must do to make the business model work?
	<ol>
		<li>Build and maintain relationships with HCPs to continue advertisements.   </li>
		<li>Provide a flawless experience for the users. </li>
	</ol>
	
</li>

<li>Costs: What are the costs and expenses to operate the business. 
	<ol>

	<ol>
		<li>We offer a unique product – editable QPLs.</li>
		<li>We have an effective marketing strategy. </li>
	</ol>
</li>
</ol>



<p>Solution and procedure for advertisement.</p>    

<p>Advertisements can be displayed on posters and on TVs in a medical clinic’s or hospital’s waiting rooms.</p>    

<p>Ads can be organised with backing clients by creating a contract. A formal contract, as detailed on the Australian government Business website, requires the details of both parties (ABN, signature etc.), description of service, payment details, intellectual property rights, obligations, restraints of trades etc (Business 2014). A lawyer can help with drafting a contract.</p>    

<p>An informal contract can be created through clearly expressed agreements, which should be documented but not necessary. However, a documented contract is more reliable.</p>   

<p>Advertising locations such as clinics and hospitals will need to be contacted via email, telephone or face-to-face meetings to propose this product.</p>   

   

<p>Solution for storing user data</p>    

<p>Express Health will use a relationship database, which uses relational model to store information in rows and columns, similar to an Excel spreadsheet, to access, modify or update data. This database uses SQL (structured query language) for programming purposes.</p>    

<p>Storing data in a relationship database enables the user to login in from different devices to access the same stored data. This is a notable feature in this app, as it enables users to login from different devices and have access to saved content. </p>


<p>Business Registration and Admin</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<dl>
			<dt>Payment</dt>
			<dd>A bank account with the business name is necessary. This requires a tax file number (TFN) and an associated Australian business number (ABN).  </dd>
			<dd>Payment gateways are required to receive payments from customers. Payment gateways such as: eWay, SecurePay, Square, WorldPay, Pin Payments and 2checkOut are trusted and reputable for businesses in Australia.   </dd>
		</dl>
	</li>
	<li>Record keeping   

<p>Businesses can claim deductions to reduce their taxable income. This project has several anticipated allowable deductions (expenses for doctors, expenses for advertising) and these tax affairs, along with tax returns and business activity statements (BAS) require punctual lodgment. Furthermore, if the app makes a profit, the business will have increasingly complex tax affairs. Therefore, a tax agent is recommended.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Google Maps</p>   

<p>Google Maps and its functions can be added to Express Health App with the help of a Maps SDK (software development kit) for Android. An SDK is a pre-built framework of functions that can be modified to suit the programmer’s needs. This accelerates application creation.</p>   

<p>The SDK will be used to implement map features to Express Health such as, finding nearby medical practices and hospitals.</p>   

<p>I (Aden) have taken on the role of UI designer, and I have been using Adobe XD v34.1 to design the prototype for our application. I am hoping to achieve an easy to use and effectively helpful design that is aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate, using a light blue and a medium grey as the main colours for the design.</p>    

<ol><p>Steps for getting started with Maps SDK for Android [2]</p>
	<li>Android Studio is recommended.</li>
	<li>Install Google Play services SDK and add Google Play services to Android Studio.</li>
	<li>Set up a Google Maps API key – </li>
	<li>Examine and modify the code – instructions and documentation available here.</li>
	<li>Debug the software.</li>
</ol>
<p>Further information is available here (https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started)</p>

<p>Adobe XD is a great program for wireframing web and app designs. It is quite easy to use and provides access to several plugins to help the designer with design and functionality. Plugins that I have used are Widgets for XD for the Navbar and Fancy Maps for the map/GPS.</p> 

   

<p>The application will go through alpha and beta stages with users testing for each before a final version is released. The final version will receive updates to fix any bugs, improve functionality and add more questions to the always growing question prompt list. The alpha stage will be basic navigation through the app with editable profile, appointment and calendar, editable consultation page where the user can add questions, they would like to ask their doctor from a question prompt list, and their own questions with an option for editing QPL questions.<p>   

  

<p>The editable QPLs are something that other apps does not have available for users. We believe that having the option to select from a list of questions and being able to add and edit your own questions will help users to get the best possible advice from their next GP visit. The editable QPL will give the user a more unique and user-friendly experience, this is an important feature that separates Express Health from other health and medical related apps. </p> 

  

<p>The home page will allow the user to access each of the pages, Consultation, Map and Profile, and will be click-able to access each page. This is to have an easy navigation process throughout the app for users who are less tech savvy and general ease of use.</p>    

 

<p>For the colour scheme of the design, I chose a light blue, white and grey. Blue is a primary colour that promotes logic, reason and intellectual thought (Kurt & Osueke 2014). This colour would stimulate the users’ brains and moods, preparing them for the app’s purpose, information sharing, management and analysis. I used grey for lines to match the light nature of the blue and white for the larger backgrounds. These three colours are aesthetically pleasing and work well together.</p>  

   

<p>The profile page will be able to be edited to keep track of the user's basic information such as age, height, weight as well as any known medical conditions and allergies they may have. This information will be able to be edited and updated by the user themselves. In later versions this information may be shared with the user’s HCP, thus bettering the results and experience of the user.</p>   

  

<p>The calendar page will be important for keeping track of appointments, this will be edited by the user to input their appointment details. In the alpha stage it will have the basic calendar and an appointment schedule detailing when the appointment is and with which doctor. In future versions this could be changed to include more information. </p>  

  

<p>The consultation page will be a focal point of the Express Health app, this is where the user will be able to access and choose, edit and add their own questions. The user will be able to make their own list of questions they will want to ask their doctor during a consultation. Being able to edit and add their own questions will make it a more personalised experience for the user. This will be able to help the user with difficult and potentially embarrassing questions. The question prompt list is a key element to make this app effective and help users achieve the best possible results from consultations.</p>    

 

<p>The map is a useful feature for locating and getting directions to a GP or doctors’ offices in the immediate local area, without having to rely on google maps. Having this function in the app itself correlates with the overall theme of ease of use, being able to locate the doctor's office without having to switch between apps. </p>   

 

<p>Throughout the design and wireframing process, I have been changing and experimenting with potential design details like the simple bubble design of the opening page and with the grid layouts for text information. This is to maintain ease of use and set a familiarity with text input areas. I used Arial for the font throughout because it is easy to read and has a smooth typeface.</p>

        <p class="lead text-primary">Roles</p>
        <p>When it comes to making an app there are many different roles, Deon and Mya are the Lead Developers, leading us in the right direction and making sure deadlines are met. Aden is the UI Designer and is responsible for the design and prototyping of the app. Glenn is the Technical Developer, reviewing the work and assisting the others with research and documentation.</p>
        <p>Prestige Worldwide is a small team of only four people, as well as our defined roles, we take on multiple other roles simultaneously. We all contribute to the research required and to the user experience. It has taken some practice, but we believe this is what will work. The larger tasks, such as research and UX are shared amongst the team to make sure the workload is more evenly spread and delegated. The defined roles that we have were chosen ourselves are based on the strengths that we already possess.</p>
        <p> We have taken on both defined roles and undefined, the reason behind that is to focus our strengths on the individual parts such as the organisation of work and direction of the project, the design of the app itself and technical application, then tackling the bulk tasks as a team.</p>

        <p class="lead text-primary">Tools and Technologies</p>
        <ul> 
      <li>MS Teams</li>
      <li>Adobe XD 34.1</li>
      <li>GitHub</li>
      <li>Doodly</li>
      <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
      <li>Atom text editor</li>
      <li>Sublime Text 3</li>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS </li>
      <li>Microsoft operating system</li>
    </ul>
<p>We chose to use all these tools, except for Adobe XD, because of availability and familiarity. For the coding we used both Atom and Sublime due to personal preference, and we used CSS and HTML. Adobe creative programs XD and Photoshop we used for design images and wireframes. We used GitHub and MS Teams because they were required programs for the assignment.</p>

        <p class="lead text-primary">Testing</p>
       <p>The alpha version testing will start with automated user interface testing to test the functionality of the app, this is to make sure all the elements are functioning correctly. This testing is performed by the developers before it is moved on to the engineers for further construction. Once this is completed it will be ready to move on to the beta version and user testing. </p>

<p>Beta version testing will be carried out using Preely User Testing, a user testing website which is available as a plugin for Adobe XD, allowing the testers to set up tests and test panels easily, while at the same time collecting the data from the tests and test panels. We will be able to invite testers, in the case of the UI testing it would be our family, friends and other students, ranging in age to view the protype and complete the set tests.  </p> 

<p>The testing tasks are kept simple so to not overload the information we receive, making the results more effective. Once collected, the information will help us make the best possible improvements to the QPL system and make any required changes. In the test, we will task the users with creating a basic profile, and then to add questions to the “My Questions” area and get the testers to add and edit their own questions.</p>  

<p>Testing will be ongoing as new features, changes in functionality and design will continue to happen. It will be considered successful for as long as we can continue to gather data and make effective improvements to Express Health.</p>  

<p>If we could have the support of university staff members, we could recruit undergraduate university students as test subjects in exchange for study credit. A recruiting site for scheduling test times and a brief description of the test, could be linked to the students’ canvas for better visibility and easier accessibility. The test subjects should have the same background as our target audience, individuals with chronic illnesses that has frequent medical consultations, so those are the types of students that will be allowed to be test subjects. Beta testing will be a qualitative study with test subjects providing open-ended feedback on the app’s features. As this project is still in its early phase, open-ended feedback would be the most helpful at this stage. Thus, we do not need a large number of test subjects, n=20 should give satisfactory results. </p>

        <p class="lead text-primary">Risks</p>
        <p>The first iteration of Express Health App will consist of a handful of features to minimise risks imposed on the group. However, there are ever-present risks such as the difficulties of programming and issues with advertising. </p>
        <p>All group members are inexperienced with the high level of programming required for creating an application with several features. Programming has a steep learning process. Inevitably, the group will be challenged by glitches and bugs and how the group conduct themselves when these situations springs up is critical and will determine if the group is successful in creating this app. Furthermore, programming bugs are often present as a series, as we fix one problem for another ten problems arise somewhere else. As bugs and glitches are an unavoidable element of programming; the group must learn to contend with these issues and implement rigorous debugging processes. </p>
        <p>The group may also experience issues advertising expenses. The high price of advertising can erase all profits and they do not guarantee clients. Furthermore, estimation cannot provide definitive return on investment (ROI) to evaluate the efficiency of ads – ads must be trailed and tested to find its effectiveness. Therefore, this will be a substantial threat to the project plan and will be a key element in the prosperity of the app. In turn, cashflow issues can grind production to a halt - one three new small businesses in Australia fail in their first year of operation, two out of four by the end of the second year, and three out of four by the fifth year. - These are extremely frightening statistics [3]  </p>
        <br>

        <p>Commercial </p>
        <p>A health consultation mobile application with editable QPLs has a certain commercial viability. However, to ensure the app is a commercial and critical success, we need to keep our market in mind.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What market are we catering to?  </li>
          <li>What other competitive products are on the market?  </li>
          <li>Are there any issues with the user interface? (Kakkar, Shah & Kakkar, 2005) </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The most devastating thing for our app would be if it’s something that users don’t even want. Fully developing this app may cost thousands of dollars and take months of work. This would all be for nothing if no one uses the app. We must be wary of the people who would be most likely to use our app. If they are not satisfied with the app and our customer service, then it will make it difficult for our app to succeed. We must also be aware of our competition. Are we really being innovative? What does our app have that makes it stand out from the others? Are there desirable features in other apps of a similar category that are missing from ours?(Kakkar, Shah & Kakkar, 2005) </p>
        <br>

        <p>Poor UI Interface </p>
        <p>People will stop using an app if it does not provide a good user experience, if it doesn’t have an accessible interface and the app is too difficult to use. App developers tend to dedicate a lot of their time to developing apps with good features and perform complex tasks but place little emphasis on UI development.  </p>
        <br>

        <p>Compatibility </p>
        <p>Currently, we are developing an application for Android that we hope to someday put on the google play store. However, if we want to expand into the iOS market then we need to upgrade our skills. Ultimately the platform that the application runs on needs to be stable and secure. </p>
        <br>

        <p>Time</p>
        <p>A lot of apps are commercial and need to be developed by a particular deadline. While we are not trying to satisfy the demands of a large corporation, we are trying to develop an Android application to a particular level by a particular date. There is often a huge reliance on events occurring the way you planned. You want the development of the app to work out the way you intended. When it doesn’t, it can seriously interfere with your deadlines. The UI designer hit a roadblock in the development of the application prototype. These setbacks were rectified but it can delay the development of an app. </p>
        <br>

        <p>Mind block </p>
        <p>We can often achieve incredible things with the power of our minds but are often prevented from performing the most mundane of tasks because of its infallibilities. Over the course of this unit, some group members have encountered situations where they do so much in a short amount of time but there are periods where they appear to be not pulling their weight. Understandably, the group can get frustrated with them. However, their lack of productivity is not because they are not working hard but because they have all these brilliant ideas in their mind, but they don’t know how to express them on paper or screen. When brain fades happen like this, it can hamper the group’s ability to develop applications in a timely manner. </p>
        <br>

        <p>Maintenance </p>
        <p>Our work is not complete once the application is launched. Ongoing support following release is critical for the success of the app. We may need to cater for software updates to the platforms the app runs on ie. IOS 13. The features of the software need to be updated regularly. Clients often have customised needs requiring constant updates and needful attention. </p>

        <p class="lead text-primary">Group processes and communications</p>
     <p>Our group keeps in regular contact with each other. Most of our communications are on the business communications platform MS Teams. We have 1-2 video meetings per
       week, and we provide daily updates on progress with our work. A new strategy employed by the group for this assessment is writing a checklist to keep track of
       progress in specific sections of the Assignment. The checklist assigns sections of the assignment that individuals, 2s or even the whole group to complete. Each
       section will also have a date that it must be completed by. For instance, this section must be completed by November 15, 12 days before the assignment due date.
 </p>

<p>We aim to have regular video conferences with each other, but we won't have regular group meetings just for the sake of it. Our meetings have lasted on average 1 hour
  but some of meetings have been more productive than others. Our last meeting was high quality as we laid out a roadmap for how we proceed with the rest of the assignment.
  i.e., the checklist However, there have been others that haven't amounted to much. </p>

<p>We will now start having video calls to work on the assessment. In our group calls, we have assigned each member a particular task in relation to Assignment description
  or marking rubric. In this assessment, we have started having video calls to actually work on the assessment together. We feel it’s more productive this way.
</p>

<p>The checklist established by the group aims to keep track of everyone’s progress. and ensure an equal workload. It sets out the specific tasks and sections of the
  assignment that each group member must complete. This can change if some group members are given a disproportionate workload or that they can’t complete their work due
  to unforeseen circumstances.  </p>

<p>We have made a pledge as a group to let our fellow comrades know if we are struggling with particular sections of the assignment and allow for appropriate review before
  posting to the GitHub. For instance, one group member found it difficult to post their work to the GitHub website. When they tried, they did not stick to the template and
  almost destroyed the Website. They now consult the web designer of the group to review the HTML code before posting to the website.</p>

<p>We don't have a clear protocol for if a group member suddenly stops responding to communications. We originally had 6 members in our group at the start of Assessment 2.
  2 members dropped out early on, but only 1 clearly indicated that they were not continuing with this subject while the other was deemed to have left due to not responding
  to any communications for an extended period. Ultimately, the group managed to carry on as a four-person team. Our current timelines for the Assignment operate under the
  assumption that all 4 active members will complete their assigned tasks by the deadlines set by the group and that team members will inform the group of any circumstances
  that may affect them completing their work on time. If a group member was to suddenly drop out, we would call an emergency group meeting and equally distribute the
  inactive group members workload among the rest of the group.</p>
