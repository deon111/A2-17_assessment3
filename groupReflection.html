  <p>This group assignment for me personally felt less stressful, we started on time and organized a checklist so that we could keep on top of report content. This proved to be quite helpful for us as team, helping us to keep up with each other’s progress and deadlines. I also felt that the work was evenly delegated between team members. During this assignment we had less team meetings, but we managed to get work done more efficiently, this was due to the use of a checklist and setting deadlines of when to complete content. </p>

<p>I found this assignment to be quite interesting as I learned how to use a new program, Adobe XD. Learning how to use Adobe XD was a great experience and pushed me towards a career that I would really enjoy. It was surprising to me how fun this type of work can be. </p>

<p>One thing that could have been improved was meeting deadlines more efficiently, most were completed ahead of time, but not all of them. This is not necessarily bad but can always be improved. The overall efficiency of the group was improved since the last group effort.</p>

  <p>The group performed reasonably well by combining their efforts to produce A3 and there were sections that went well. A list of the assignment content was created and each item was allocated to an individual, as such, the workload was somewhat distributed equally. Furthermore, there was a moderate increase in group member’s dedication to the group, this was demonstrated well by Mya who took a leadership and initiative. In A2, I was the primary leader, however having a secondary leader in this A3 reduced a great deal of stress and burden. </p>
  <p>While improvements from A2 were evident, there were many issues that hindered our progress. Some group members were not proactive, they were passively observing, but not actively engaged. Moreover, it was difficult to organise the group during the early stages of A3 production; early stages of A3 were plagued with slow responses, ignored messages and delays.  </p>
  <p>I was surprised by the honestly displayed by all group members. All group members were transparent, they were upfront when they were not able to complete a task on time and open to new ideas. Honesty and transparency created a strong sense of trust in the group. </p>
  <p>Conflict is unavoidable in group work and in this assignment, there were several conflicts. However, I learned that if the issues are addressed immediately, then a solution can be found. Unexpressed issues or concerns are detrimental, they create resentment and a breakdown of trust. Addressing such issues is a difficult task; however, it is necessary and with practice it becomes easier to assert your thoughts without fear. </p>
