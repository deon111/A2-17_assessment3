        <p class="lead text-primary"><strong>Detailed Description</strong></p>
        <p class="lead text-primary">Aims</p>
       
<p>The aim is to construct a smartphone app prototype in Adobe XD to display our vision for Express Health and to show the codes we plan to use for creating the app. Express Health’s purpose is to help patients be more expressive with their HCPs and to reliably record medical consultations for patients. To achieve this, we have set out the following goals that the prototype should display: Being able to create personal accounts, accepting user input for basic personal information, being able to edit and use the editable QPLs which also includes the recording features, being able to edit consultation times in the calendar feature and being able to use the geolocation feature. The codes that will be used to program these features will be included in the Plans and Progresses section.</p>  

<p>Personal Accounts</p> 

<p>Personal accounts are an important feature to have, this stores the user’s personal information, such as their current height, weight and age, as well as allowing them to input any know allergies they have, i.e. penicillin or other types of medications, and any known medical conditions they may have, i.e. Arthritis or Asthma.</p>  

<p>The Question Prompt List </p>

<p>The Question Prompt List is the main focus of ExpressHealth. For this feature we want to have a vast number of QPL questions available for the user, covering many medical areas. This is to help the user during a consultation, providing them with questions to ask their HCP. The user will also be able to edit, add and record their own questions, this is an innovation of the QPL system and will help the users, for example if they have a question that they can’t find in the QPL database.</p>  

<p>Calender </p>

<p>The calendar feature will allow the user to store and edit their appointment information, this will include the time, date and doctor, that their appointment is with. An element of this feature will be the app sending push notifications to remind the user of an upcoming appointment. This feature is to help the user to keep track of appointments.</p>  

<p>Geolocation</p> 

<p>The Geolocation will be used for a map element, this map is for the user to easily locate and access directions to GPs and medical centres in their local area, using the IP location of the user. The idea behind this was to allow the user to access a direct map rather than having to switch in between apps, this is for convenience to the user. </p>

        <p class="lead text-primary">Roles</p>
        <p>When it comes to making an app there are many different roles, Deon and Mya are the Lead Developers, leading us in the right direction and making sure deadlines are met. Aden is the UI Designer and is responsible for the design and prototyping of the app. Glenn is the Technical Developer, reviewing the work and assisting the others with research and documentation.</p>  

<p>Prestige Worldwide is a small team of only four people, as well as our defined roles, we take on multiple other roles simultaneously. We all contribute to the research required and to the user experience. It has taken some practice, but we believe this is what will work. The larger tasks, such as research and UX are shared amongst the team to make sure the workload is more evenly spread and delegated. The defined roles that we have were chosen ourselves are based on the strengths that we already possess.</p>  

<p> We have taken on both defined roles and undefined, the reason behind that is to focus our strengths on the individual parts such as the organisation of work and direction of the project, the design of the app itself and technical application, then tackling the bulk tasks as a team.</p>

        <p class="lead text-primary">Testing</p>
       <p>The testing will start with automated user interface testing to test the functionality of the app, this is to make sure all the elements are functioning correctly. Once this is completed the next step is prototype testing. This is done but setting tasks for the users to test the features and elements of the app, this will be done using Preerly User testing, a user testing website which is available as a plugin for Adobe XD, allowing the testers to set up tests and test panels easily, while at the same time collecting the data from the tests and test panels. </p>

<p>The testing tasks are kept simple so to not overload the information we receive, making the results more effective. Once collected, the information will help us make the best possible improvements to the QPL system and make any required changes. In the test, we will task the users with creating a basic profile, and then to add questions to the “My Questions” area and get the testers to add and edit their own questions. </p> 

<p>Testing will be ongoing as new features, changes in functionality and design will continue to happen. It will be considered successful for as long as we can continue to gather data and make effective improvements to the ExpressHealth app.</P>
