  <p class="lead text-primary">What went well</p>
  <p>We delegated tasks early in the assessment based on individual abilities and interests. For example, one group member was able to develop a prototype for the app and another designed the website and created the video as they had the most expertise out of the group in those areas. The checklist assigned group members tasks relating to assignment criteria and marking rubric and set out a specific date that the task was to be completed by. This helped to improve overall organisation from Assessment 2. Better interactive collaboration in the assignment was achieved by group members doing sections together. </p>
  <p>There was also a more equal distribution of workload, unlike Assessment 2 where almost half of the Assignment was completed by just one group member. There was more time for feedback which improved the quality of the report during revisions. Team members also had more time to help with the sections they were not assigned to do. More active listening was involved which resulted in better coordination and confidence in doing tasks assigned.   </p>
  <p>Group members have shown great flexibility in this assignment, as they were able to adjust to difficult situations they encountered. If someone was behind on their work, another member would compensate for them. Furthermore, everyone addressed issues without complaining or showing signs of stress. </p>

  <p class="lead text-primary">What could be improved</p>
  <p>Similar to A2, the group suffered from lack of organisation, especially during early stages of production. Only the deadline forced everyone commit more, however this is a stressful situation that could have been avoided. Furthermore, all group should have assisted in problem solving. Problems can be difficult to manage and there were countless problems encountered in this assignment, group members have agreed that there was a lack of solutions offered. In future assignments, the group will endeavor to rectify these mistakes.  </p>

  <p class="lead text-primary">Thing that was surprised</p>
  <p> A few revisions were needed to adequately finish each section. There was more work involved in writing the report for this assessment. Moreover, a high level of coordination with other group members was necessary to complete this report. All sections were interconnected. There was less coordination during the previous assessment, as the report sections were less connected.</p>

  <p class="lead text-primary">Thing that we learned</p>
  <p>Being flexible with tasks assigned or taken and being willing to fill in for other members was important for finishing the project. Having team members that had different strengths and weaknesses allowed for better distribution of tasks. Team members were delegated tasks they were more experienced with. Feedback given for the report was also helpful as there were different points of view. </p>

  <p>This group assignment for me personally felt less stressful, we started on time and organized a checklist so that we could keep on top of report content. This proved to be quite helpful for us as team, helping us to keep up with each other’s progress and deadlines. I also felt that the work was evenly delegated between team members. During this assignment we had less team meetings, but we managed to get work done more efficiently, this was due to the use of a checklist and setting deadlines of when to complete content. </p>

<p>I found this assignment to be quite interesting as I learned how to use a new program, Adobe XD. Learning how to use Adobe XD was a great experience and pushed me towards a career that I would really enjoy. It was surprising to me how fun this type of work can be. </p>

<p>One thing that could have been improved was meeting deadlines more efficiently, most were completed ahead of time, but not all of them. This is not necessarily bad but can always be improved. The overall efficiency of the group was improved since the last group effort.</p>

  <p>The group performed reasonably well by combining their efforts to produce A3 and there were sections that went well. A list of the assignment content was created and each item was allocated to an individual, as such, the workload was somewhat distributed equally. Furthermore, there was a moderate increase in group member’s dedication to the group, this was demonstrated well by Mya who took a leadership and initiative. In A2, I was the primary leader, however having a secondary leader in this A3 reduced a great deal of stress and burden. </p>
  <p>While improvements from A2 were evident, there were many issues that hindered our progress. Some group members were not proactive, they were passively observing, but not actively engaged. Moreover, it was difficult to organise the group during the early stages of A3 production; early stages of A3 were plagued with slow responses, ignored messages and delays.  </p>
  <p>I was surprised by the honestly displayed by all group members. All group members were transparent, they were upfront when they were not able to complete a task on time and open to new ideas. Honesty and transparency created a strong sense of trust in the group. </p>
  <p>Conflict is unavoidable in group work and in this assignment, there were several conflicts. However, I learned that if the issues are addressed immediately, then a solution can be found. Unexpressed issues or concerns are detrimental, they create resentment and a breakdown of trust. Addressing such issues is a difficult task; however, it is necessary and with practice it becomes easier to assert your thoughts without fear. </p>

  <p>This was a bigger assignment in scope than Assessment 2 but the group seemed to handle their work more comfortably. There wasn't one whole section still incomplete on the
final day as was the case in the first group assignment. This may be because we developed a checklist to keep track of our progress in the Assignment. The checklist
delegated tasks relating to particular Assignment sections and Marking Rubric. In Assessment 2, one group member was responsible for almost half of the Assessment
content. The checklist ensured there was a relatively even distribution of work among group members. However, there were some things that could be improved.</p>

<p>As with the 2nd assessment, there were delays in group members responding to messages/posts. While group members had fewer issues completing their work, it would be nice to
get progress updates more often. We may have also benefitted from more Interactive group work. For many tasks in the checklist, we delegated a single group member to
complete that. I feel that some of the quality of the Assignment content could be improved if we held video meetings to complete some of the assignment together. Our video
meetings were mostly for planning rather than doing.</p>

<p>Everyone seemed to have decent pre-existing knowledge of the Assignment content which allowed us to delegate tasks more easily. For example, one group member specialises in
Web Design and was able to significantly improve upon the website from Assessment 2 while another had some proficiency in Adobe XD which allowed them to design a polished
prototype for our Express Health app.</p>

<p>It is important to work with people that not only want to do well in the particular assignment but actually have a passion for IT and wish to work in a similar field. Having
a collective passion about what the group is doing can achieve great results as a group. </p>
