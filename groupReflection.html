  <p>This group assignment for me personally felt less stressful, we started on time and organized a checklist so that we could keep on top of report content. This proved to be quite helpful for us as team, helping us to keep up with each otherâ€™s progress and deadlines. I also felt that the work was evenly delegated between team members. During this assignment we had less team meetings, but we managed to get work done more efficiently, this was due to the use of a checklist and setting deadlines of when to complete content. </p>

<p>I found this assignment to be quite interesting as I learned how to use a new program, Adobe XD. Learning how to use Adobe XD was a great experience and pushed me towards a career that I would really enjoy. It was surprising to me how fun this type of work can be. </p>

<p>One thing that could have been improved was meeting deadlines more efficiently, most were completed ahead of time, but not all of them. This is not necessarily bad but can always be improved. The overall efficiency of the group was improved since the last group effort.</p>
